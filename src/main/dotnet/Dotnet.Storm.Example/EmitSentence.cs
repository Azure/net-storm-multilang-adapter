Dictionary<TKey,TValue> is a generic version of Hashtable; it uses the generic structure KeyValuePair<TKey,TValue> for enumeration instead of DictionaryEntry. List<T> is a generic version of ArrayList. There are generic Queue<T> and Stack<T> classes that correspond to the nongeneric versions. There are generic and nongeneric versions of SortedList<TKey,TValue>. Both versions are hybrids of a dictionary and a list. The SortedDictionary<TKey,TValue> generic class is a pure dictionary and has no nongeneric counterpart. The LinkedList<T> generic class is a true linked list and has no nongeneric counterpart." }
